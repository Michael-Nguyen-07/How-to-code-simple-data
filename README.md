A course offered by the University of British Columbia through edX with a focus on learning a systematic programming method rather than a programming language through Dr-Racket.
## Learning Outcomes Include:
* Develop program requirements
* Make your programs more reliable by building tests as an integral part of the programming process.
* Produce programs with consistent structure that are easy to modify later
* How to represent information as data
* How to focus each part of your program on a single task
* How to use examples and tests to clarify what your program should do
* How to simplify the structure of your program using common patterns
